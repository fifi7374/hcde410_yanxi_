    "I’m interested in researching the relationship between traffic accident death rates and population in Washington State. Traffic accidents are a big safe issue, and understanding how population factors into accident rates could give helpful insights for city planning, resource allocation, and public safety. By focusing on Washington, this project can also be more specific and manageable, while still providing insights that might apply to other states."

    "I’m planning to dive deeper into the relationship between population and traffic accident rates in different regions of Washington State. Beyond just understanding how population size and density relate to accidents, I want to investigate other factors that might influence these rates, such as driver demographics (age, race), alcohol involvement, and the timing of accidents. This project aims to uncover patterns in these factors to guide targeted safety interventions in high-risk areas."

    "I did some studies have show that high population density areas often have more traffic accidents, but findings suggest other factors, like age and substance use, play significant roles. For example, studies from the National highway traffic safety administration website have show how young, inexperienced drivers and alcohol are common accidents maker. The Insurance institute for highway safety has also documented racial disparities in accident rates, which may be tied to factors like socity status and vehicle type."
