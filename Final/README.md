Title:
Exploring the Relationship Between Population and Traffic Counts Across Counties (2012–2022)

## Description
This project investigates the relationship between population size and traffic counts across various counties in Washington State over a ten-year period (2012–2022). The goal is to determine whether higher traffic counts are caused by population growth or other factors influencing traffic patterns.

The report contains:

Analysis of population and traffic trends over time.
A comparison of county-level population and traffic data.
Normalized traffic rates (traffic per 10,000 people) to uncover interesting patterns.
This research serves as a comprehensive example of applying human-centered data analysis to address meaningful questions.

## Findings
Population Trends: Population steadily increased from 2012–2022.
Traffic Trends: Traffic counts varied over time and did not perfectly align with population growth.
Normalized Traffic Rates: Smaller counties like Ferry and Pend Oreille showed high traffic per capita, while larger counties like King had lower normalized rates.

## Implications
This study highlights the importance of considering normalized traffic rates rather than absolute counts when assessing traffic patterns. Findings can inform traffic management policies, urban planning, and safety initiatives.
